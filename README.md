# Cattle-Heat-Stress-UAV
Developed by Keshawa M. Dadallage, this repository contains algorithms for processing UAV-based thermal-RGB video to monitor heat stress in drylot dairy cattle. Using Mask R-CNN and Centroid Tracking, the algorithms detect cows, estimate body surface temperature, and provide real-time heat stress assessment.
